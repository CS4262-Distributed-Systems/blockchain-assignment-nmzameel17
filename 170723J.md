# CONCEPT OF BLOCK CHAIN

Blockchain is a distributed decentralised network that aims to give immutability and security of data. Without a central authority to validate and verify the transactions, each transaction in a Blockchain network is considered to be truly secure and validated. 


1. Smart Contracts and Chaincode
Think of smart contracts as governing transactions, whereas chaincode governs how smart contracts are packaged for deployment. A smart contract is defined within a chaincode. Multiple smart contracts can be defined within the same chaincode.

2. Consensus
A consensus algorithm is a mechanism in computer science used to establish agreement on a single data value across distributed processes or systems. A consensus algorithm is a protocol through which all the parties of the blockchain network come to a common agreement (consensus) on the present data state of the ledger and be able to trust unknown peers in a distributed computing environment.
